# Credits
I created this project for personal needs to have a mean starter project based on typescript.

A majority of this quick start's content was inspired by:
The Sahat hackaton starter: https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter

The Microsoft typescript node starter: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter
